## Setup
durable_rules has been tested in MacOS X, Ubuntu Linux and Windows.
### Redis install
durable_rules relies on Redis version 2.8  
 
_Mac_  
1. Download [Redis](http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-2.8.4.tar.gz)   
2. Extract code, compile and start Redis

For more information go to: http://redis.io/download  

_Windows_  
1. Download Redis binaries from [MSTechOpen](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases)  
2. Extract binaries and start Redis  

For more information go to: https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis  

Note: To test applications locally you can also use a Redis [cloud service](reference.md#cloud-setup) 

### First App
Now that your cache ready, let's write a simple rule:  

1. Start a terminal  
2. Create a directory for your app: `mkdir firstapp` `cd firstapp`  
3. In the new directory `sudo pip install durable_rules` (this will download durable_rules and its dependencies)  
4. In that same directory create a test.py file using your favorite editor  
5. Copy/Paste and save the following code:
  ```python
  from durable.lang import *
  with ruleset('test'):
      @when_all(m.subject == 'World')
      def say_hello(c):
          print ('Hello {0}'.format(c.m.subject))

      @when_start
      def start(host):
          host.post('test', { 'subject': 'World' })

  run_all()
  ```
7. In the terminal type `python test.py`  
8. You should see the message: `Hello World`  

Note 1: If you are using a redis service outside your local host, replace the last line with:
  ```python
  run_all([{'host': 'host_name', 'port': port, 'password': 'password'}]);
  ```

## Basics
### Rules
A rule is the basic building block of the framework. The rule antecendent defines the conditions that need to be satisfied to execute the rule consequent (action). By convention `m` represents the data to be evaluated by a given rule.

* `when_all` and `when_any` annotate the antecendent definition of a rule
* `when_start` annotates the action to be taken when starting the ruleset  
  
```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('test'):
    # antecedent
    @when_all(m.subject == 'World')
    def say_hello(c):
        # consequent
        print('Hello {0}'.format(c.m.subject))

    # on ruleset start
    @when_start
    def start(host):    
        host.post('test', { 'subject': 'World' })

run_all()
```
### Facts
Facts represent the data that defines a knowledge base. After facts are asserted as JSON objects. Facts are stored until they are retracted. When a fact satisfies a rule antecedent, the rule consequent is executed.

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('animal'):
    # will be triggered by 'Kermit eats flies'
    @when_all((m.predicate == 'eats') & (m.object == 'flies'))
    def frog(c):
        c.assert_fact({ 'subject': c.m.subject, 'predicate': 'is', 'object': 'frog' })

    @when_all((m.predicate == 'eats') & (m.object == 'worms'))
    def bird(c):
        c.assert_fact({ 'subject': c.m.subject, 'predicate': 'is', 'object': 'bird' })

    # will be chained after asserting 'Kermit is frog'
    @when_all((m.predicate == 'is') & (m.object == 'frog'))
    def green(c):
        c.assert_fact({ 'subject': c.m.subject, 'predicate': 'is', 'object': 'green' })

    @when_all((m.predicate == 'is') & (m.object == 'bird'))
    def black(c):
        c.assert_fact({ 'subject': c.m.subject, 'predicate': 'is', 'object': 'black' })

    @when_all(+m.subject)
    def output(c):
        print('Fact: {0} {1} {2}'.format(c.m.subject, c.m.predicate, c.m.object))

    @when_start
    def start(host):
        host.assert_fact('animal', { 'subject': 'Kermit', 'predicate': 'eats', 'object': 'flies' })

run_all()
```

Facts can also be asserted using the http API. For the example above, run the following command:  

<sub>`curl -H "content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"subject": "Tweety", "predicate": "eats", "object": "worms"}' http://localhost:5000/animal/facts`</sub>

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Events
Events can be posted to and evaluated by rules. An event is an ephemeral fact, that is, a fact retracted right before executing a consequent. Thus, events can only be observed once. Events are stored until they are observed. 

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('risk'):
    @when_all(c.first << m.t == 'purchase',
              c.second << m.location != c.first.location)
    # the event pair will only be observed once
    def fraud(c):
        print('Fraud detected -> {0}, {1}'.format(c.first.location, c.second.location))

    @when_start
    def start(host):
        # 'post' submits events, try 'assert' instead and to see differt behavior
        host.post('risk', {'t': 'purchase', 'location': 'US'});
        host.post('risk', {'t': 'purchase', 'location': 'CA'});

run_all()
```

Events can be posted using the http API. When the example above is listening, run the following commands:  

<sub>`curl -H "content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"t": "purchase", "location": "BR"}' http://localhost:5000/risk/events`</sub>  
<sub>`curl -H "content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"t": "purchase", "location": "JP"}' http://localhost:5000/risk/events`</sub>  

**Note:**  

*Using facts in the example above will produce the following output:*   

<sub>`Fraud detected -> US, CA`</sub>  
<sub>`Fraud detected -> CA, US`</sub>  

*The reason is because both facts satisfy the first condition m.t == 'purchase' and each fact satisfies the second condition m.location != c.first.location in relation to the facts which satisfied the first.*  

*Given that, you might be wondering why post behaves differently: the reason is because an event is an ephemeral fact, as soon as it is scheduled to be dispatched, it is retracted. When using post in the example above, by the time the second pair is calculated the events have already been retracted.*  

*And why is the difference between events and facts important? Retracting events before dispatch reduces the number of combinations to be calculated for dispatch. Thus, processing events is much more efficient (orders of magnitude faster in some cases).*  

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### State
Context state is available when a consequent is executed. The same context state is passed across rule execution. Context state is stored until it is deleted. Context state changes can be evaluated by rules. By convention `s` represents the state to be evaluated by a rule.

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('flow'):
    # state condition uses 's'
    @when_all(s.status == 'start')
    def start(c):
        # state update on 's'
        c.s.status = 'next' 
        print('start')

    @when_all(s.status == 'next')
    def next(c):
        c.s.status = 'last' 
        print('next')

    @when_all(s.status == 'last')
    def last(c):
        c.s.status = 'end' 
        print('last')
        # deletes state at the end
        c.delete_state()

    @when_start
    def on_start(host):
        # modifies context state
        host.patch_state('flow', { 'status': 'start' })

run_all()
```
State can also be retrieved and modified using the http API. When the example above is running, try the following commands:  
<sub>`curl -H "content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"status": "next"}' http://localhost:5000/flow/state`</sub>  

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  
### Identity
Facts with the same property names and values are considered equal when asserted or retracted. Events with the same property names and values are considered different when posted because the posting time matters. 

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('bookstore'):
    # this rule will trigger for events with status
    @when_all(+m.status)
    def event(c):
        print('Reference {0} status {1}'.format(c.m.reference, c.m.status))

    @when_all(+m.name)
    def fact(c):
        print('Added {0}'.format(c.m.name))
        c.retract_fact({
            'name': 'The new book',
            'reference': '75323',
            'price': 500,
            'seller': 'bookstore'
        })

    # this rule will be triggered when the fact is retracted
    @when_all(none(+m.name))
    def empty(c):
        print('No books')

    @when_start
    def start(host):    
        # will return 0 because the fact assert was successful 
        print(host.assert_fact('bookstore', {
            'name': 'The new book',
            'seller': 'bookstore',
            'reference': '75323',
            'price': 500
        }))

        # will return 212 because the fact has already been asserted
        print(host.assert_fact('bookstore', {
            'reference': '75323',
            'name': 'The new book',
            'price': 500,
            'seller': 'bookstore'
        }))

        # will return 0 because a new event is being posted
        print(host.post('bookstore', {
            'reference': '75323',
            'status': 'Active'
        }))

        # will return 0 because a new event is being posted
        print(host.post('bookstore', {
            'reference': '75323',
            'status': 'Active'
        }))
        
run_all()
```

## Antecendents
### Simple Filter
A rule antecedent is an expression. The left side of the expression represents an event or fact property. The right side defines a pattern to be matched. By convention events or facts are represented with the `m` name. Context state are represented with the `s` name.  

Logical operators:  
* Unary: - (does not exist), + (exists)  
* Logical operators: &, |  
* Relational operators: < , >, <=, >=, ==, !=  

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('expense'):
    @when_all((m.subject == 'approve') | (m.subject == 'ok'))
    def approved(c):
        print ('Approved subject: {0}'.format(c.m.subject))
        
    @when_start
    def start(host):
        host.post('expense', { 'subject': 'approve'})
        
run_all()
```  
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Pattern Matching
durable_rules implements a simple pattern matching dialect. Similar to lua, it uses % to escape, which vastly simplifies writing expressions. Expressions are compiled down into a deterministic state machine, thus backtracking is not supported. Event processing is O(n) guaranteed (n being the size of the event).  

**Repetition**  
\+ 1 or more repetitions  
\* 0 or more repetitions  
? optional (0 or 1 occurrence)  

**Special**  
() group  
| disjunct  
[] range  
{} repeat  

**Character classes**  
.	all characters  
%a	letters  
%c	control characters  
%d	digits  
%l	lower case letters  
%p	punctuation characters  
%s	space characters  
%u	upper case letters  
%w	alphanumeric characters  
%x	hexadecimal digits  

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('match'):
    @when_all(m.url.matches('(https?://)?([0-9a-z.-]+)%.[a-z]{2,6}(/[A-z0-9_.-]+/?)*'))
    def approved(c):
        print ('match url ->{0}'.format(c.m.url))

    @when_start
    def start(host):
        host.post('match', { 'url': 'https://github.com' })
        host.post('match', { 'url': 'http://github.com/jruizgit/rul!es' })
        host.post('match', { 'url': 'https://github.com/jruizgit/rules/reference.md' })
        host.post('match', { 'url': '//rules'})
        host.post('match', { 'url': 'https://github.c/jruizgit/rules' })

run_all()
```  

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### String Operations  
The pattern matching dialect can be used for common string operations. The `imatches` function enables case insensitive pattern matching.

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('strings'):
    @when_all(m.subject.matches('hello.*'))
    def starts_with(c):
        print ('string starts with hello -> {0}'.format(c.m.subject))

    @when_all(m.subject.matches('.*hello'))
    def ends_with(c):
        print ('string ends with hello -> {0}'.format(c.m.subject))

    @when_all(m.subject.imatches('.*hello.*'))
    def contains(c):
        print ('string contains hello (case insensitive) -> {0}'.format(c.m.subject))

    @when_start
    def start(host):
        host.assert_fact('strings', { 'subject': 'HELLO world' })
        host.assert_fact('strings', { 'subject': 'world hello' })
        host.assert_fact('strings', { 'subject': 'hello hi' })
        host.assert_fact('strings', { 'subject': 'has Hello string' })
        host.assert_fact('strings', { 'subject': 'does not match' })

run_all()
```  

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents) 

### Correlated Sequence
Rules can be used to efficiently evaluate sequences of correlated events or facts. The fraud detection rule in the example below shows a pattern of three events: the second event amount being more than 200% the first event amount and the third event amount greater than the average of the other two.  

By default a correlated sequences capture distinct messages. In the example below the second event satisfies the second and the third condition, however the event will be captured only for the second condition. Use the `distinct` attribute to disable distinct event or fact correlation.

The `when_all` annotation expresses a sequence of events or facts. The `<<` operator is used to name events or facts, which can be referenced in subsequent expressions. When referencing events or facts, all properties are available. Complex patterns can be expressed using arithmetic operators.  

Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /
```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('risk'):
    @when_all(# distinct(True),
              c.first << m.amount > 10,
              c.second << m.amount > c.first.amount * 2,
              c.third << m.amount > (c.first.amount + c.second.amount) / 2)
    def detected(c):
        print('fraud detected -> {0}'.format(c.first.amount))
        print('               -> {0}'.format(c.second.amount))
        print('               -> {0}'.format(c.third.amount))
        
    @when_start
    def start(host):
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 50 })
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 200 })
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 251 })

run_all()
```  

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Choice of Sequences
durable_rules allows expressing and efficiently evaluating richer events sequences In the example below any of the two event\fact sequences will trigger an action. 

The following two functions can be used and combined to define richer event sequences:  
* all: a set of event or fact patterns. All of them are required to match to trigger an action.  
* any: a set of event or fact patterns. Any one match will trigger an action.  

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('expense'):
    @when_any(all(c.first << m.subject == 'approve', 
                  c.second << m.amount == 1000), 
              all(c.third << m.subject == 'jumbo', 
                  c.fourth << m.amount == 10000))
    def action(c):
        if c.first:
            print ('Approved {0} {1}'.format(c.first.subject, c.second.amount))
        else:
            print ('Approved {0} {1}'.format(c.third.subject, c.fourth.amount))
    
    @when_start
    def start(host):
        host.post('expense', { 'subject': 'approve' })
        host.post('expense', { 'amount': 1000 })
        host.post('expense', { 'subject': 'jumbo' })
        host.post('expense', { 'amount': 10000 })

run_all()
```
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents) 

### Lack of Information
In some cases lack of information is meaningful. The `none` function can be used in rules with correlated sequences to evaluate the lack of information.  

*Note: the `none` function requires information to reason about lack of information. That is, it will not trigger any actions if no events or facts have been registered in the corresponding rule.*

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('risk'):
    @when_all(c.first << m.t == 'deposit',
              none(m.t == 'balance'),
              c.third << m.t == 'withrawal',
              c.fourth << m.t == 'chargeback')
    def detected(c):
        print('fraud detected {0} {1} {2}'.format(c.first.t, c.third.t, c.fourth.t))
        
    @when_start
    def start(host):
        host.post('risk', { 't': 'deposit' })
        host.post('risk', { 't': 'withrawal' })
        host.post('risk', { 't': 'chargeback' })
        
run_all()
```

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Nested Objects
Queries on nested events or facts are also supported. The `.` notation is used for defining conditions on properties in nested objects.  

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('expense'):
    # use the '.' notation to match properties in nested objects
    @when_all(c.bill << (m.t == 'bill') & (m.invoice.amount > 50),
              c.account << (m.t == 'account') & (m.payment.invoice.amount == c.bill.invoice.amount))
    def approved(c):
        print ('bill amount  ->{0}'.format(c.bill.invoice.amount))
        print ('account payment amount ->{0}'.format(c.account.payment.invoice.amount))
        
    @when_start
    def start(host):
        # one level of nesting
        host.post('expense', {'t': 'bill', 'invoice': {'amount': 100}})
        
        #two levels of nesting
        host.post('expense', {'t': 'account', 'payment': {'invoice': {'amount': 100}}})

run_all()
```

### Arrays

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('risk'):
    # matching primitive array
    @when_all(m.payments.allItems((item > 100) & (item < 500)))
    def rule1(c):
        print('fraud 1 detected {0}'.format(c.m.payments))

    # matching object array
    @when_all(m.payments.allItems((item.amount < 250) | (item.amount >= 300)))
    def rule2(c):
        print('fraud 2 detected {0}'.format(c.m.payments))

    # pattern matching string array
    @when_all(m.cards.anyItem(item.matches('three.*')))
    def rule3(c):
        print('fraud 3 detected {0}'.format(c.m.cards))

    # matching nested arrays
    @when_all(m.payments.anyItem(item.allItems(item < 100)))
    def rule4(c):
        print('fraud 4 detected {0}'.format(c.m.payments))

    @when_start
    def start(host):
        host.post('risk', {'payments': [ 150, 300, 450 ]})
        host.post('risk', {'payments': [ { 'amount' : 200 }, { 'amount' : 300 }, { 'amount' : 450 } ]})
        host.post('risk', {'cards': [ 'one card', 'two cards', 'three cards' ]})
        host.post('risk', {'payments': [ [ 10, 20, 30 ], [ 30, 40, 50 ], [ 10, 20 ] ]})  
        
run_all()
```

### Facts and Events as rvalues

Aside from scalars (strings, number and boolean values), it is possible to use the fact or event observed on the right side of an expression. This allows for efficient evaluation in the scripting client before reaching the Redis backend.  

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('risk'):
    # compares properties in the same event, this expression is evaluated in the client 
    @when_all(m.debit > m.credit * 2)
    def fraud_1(c):
        print('debit {0} more than twice the credit {1}'.format(c.m.debit, c.m.credit))

    # compares two correlated events, this expression is evaluated in the backend
    @when_all(c.first << m.amount > 100,
              c.second << m.amount > c.first.amount + m.amount / 2)
    def fraud_2(c):
        print('fraud detected ->{0}'.format(c.first.amount))
        print('fraud detected ->{0}'.format(c.second.amount))
        
    @when_start
    def start(host):    
        host.post('risk', { 'debit': 220, 'credit': 100 })
        host.post('risk', { 'debit': 150, 'credit': 100 })
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 200 })
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 500 })
        
run_all()
```

## Consequents
### Conflict Resolution
Event and fact evaluation can lead to multiple consequents. The triggering order can be controlled by using the `pri` (salience) function. Actions with lower value are executed first. The default value for all actions is 0.

In this example, notice how the last rule is triggered first, as it has the highest priority.
```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('attributes'):
    @when_all(pri(3), m.amount < 300)
    def first_detect(c):
        print('attributes P3 ->{0}'.format(c.m.amount))
        
    @when_all(pri(2), m.amount < 200)
    def second_detect(c):
        print('attributes P2 ->{0}'.format(c.m.amount))
        
    @when_all(pri(1), m.amount < 100)
    def third_detect(c):
        print('attributes P1 ->{0}'.format(c.m.amount))
        
    @when_start
    def start(host):
        host.assert_fact('attributes', { 'amount': 50 })
        host.assert_fact('attributes', { 'amount': 150 })
        host.assert_fact('attributes', { 'amount': 250 })
        
run_all()
```

### Action Batches
When a high number of events or facts satisfy a consequent, the consequent results can be delivered in batches.

* count: defines the exact number of times the rule needs to be satisfied before scheduling the action.   
* cap: defines the maximum number of times the rule needs to be satisfied before scheduling the action.  

This example batches exaclty three approvals and caps the number of rejects to two:  
```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('expense'):
    # this rule will trigger as soon as three events match the condition
    @when_all(count(3), m.amount < 100)
    def approve(c):
        print('approved {0}'.format(c.m))

    # this rule will be triggered when 'expense' is asserted batching at most two results       
    @when_all(cap(2),
              c.expense << m.amount >= 100,
              c.approval << m.review == True)
    def reject(c):
        print('rejected {0}'.format(c.m))

    @when_start
    def start(host):
        host.post_batch('expense', [{ 'amount': 10 },
                                    { 'amount': 20 },
                                    { 'amount': 100 },
                                    { 'amount': 30 },
                                    { 'amount': 200 },
                                    { 'amount': 400 }])
        host.assert_fact('expense', { 'review': True })

run_all()
```

### Async Actions  
The consequent action can be asynchronous. When the action is finished, the `complete` function has to be called. By default an action is considered abandoned after 5 seconds. This value can be changed by returning a different number in the action function or extended by calling `renew_action_lease`.

```python
from durable.lang import *
import threading

with ruleset('flow'):
    timer = None

    def start_timer(time, callback):
        timer = threading.Timer(time, callback)
        timer.daemon = True    
        timer.start()

    @when_all(s.state == 'first')
    # async actions take a callback argument to signal completion
    def first(c, complete):
        def end_first():
            c.s.state = 'second'     
            print('first completed')

            # completes the action after 3 seconds
            complete(None)
        
        start_timer(3, end_first)
        
    @when_all(s.state == 'second')
    def second(c, complete):
        def end_second():
            c.s.state = 'third'
            print('second completed')

            # completes the action after 6 seconds
            # use the first argument to signal an error
            complete(Exception('error detected'))

        start_timer(6, end_second)

        # overrides the 5 second default abandon timeout
        return 10

    @when_start
    def on_start(host):
        host.patch_state('flow', { 'state': 'first' })
        
run_all()
```
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  
### Unhandled Exceptions  
When exceptions are not handled by actions, they are stored in the context state. This enables writing exception handling rules.

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('flow'):
    
    @when_all(m.action == 'start')
    def first(c):
        raise Exception('Unhandled Exception!')

    # when the exception property exists
    @when_all(+s.exception)
    def second(c):
        print(c.s.exception)
        c.s.exception = None
        
    @when_start
    def on_start(host):
        host.post('flow', { 'action': 'start' })
        
run_all()
```
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Fault Tolerance  
Consequent execution is transactional and atomic. That is, if the process crashes in the middle of a consequent execution, no facts will be asserted nor retracted, no events will posted and the context state will not be changed. The consequent will be retried a few seconds after process restart.  

```python
from durable.lang import *
import os

with ruleset('flow'):
    @when_all(m.status == 'start')
    def start(c):
        c.post({ 'status': 'next' })
        print('start')

    @when_all(m.status == 'next')
    # the process will always exit here every time the action is run
    # when restarting the process this action will be retried after a few seconds
    def next(c):
        c.post({ 'status': 'last' })
        print('next')
        os._exit(1)

    @when_all(m.status == 'last')
    def last(c):
        print('last')
        
    @when_start
    def on_start(host):
        host.post('flow', { 'status': 'start' })
        
run_all()
```

## Flow Structures
### Statechart
Rules can be organized using statecharts. A statechart is a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). The state context is in one of a number of possible states with conditional transitions between these states. 

Statechart rules:  
* A statechart can have one or more states.  
* A statechart requires an initial state.  
* An initial state is defined as a vertex without incoming edges.  
* A state can have zero or more triggers.  
* A state can have zero or more states (see [nested states](reference.md#nested-states)).  
* A trigger has a destination state.  
* A trigger can have a rule (absence means state enter).  
* A trigger can have an action.  

```python
from durable.lang import *

with statechart('expense'):
    # initial state 'input' with two triggers
    with state('input'):
        # trigger to move to 'denied' given a condition
        @to('denied')
        @when_all((m.subject == 'approve') & (m.amount > 1000))
        # action executed before state change
        def denied(c):
            print ('denied amount {0}'.format(c.m.amount))
        
        @to('pending')    
        @when_all((m.subject == 'approve') & (m.amount <= 1000))
        def request(c):
            print ('requesting approve amount {0}'.format(c.m.amount))
    
    # intermediate state 'pending' with two triggers
    with state('pending'):
        @to('approved')
        @when_all(m.subject == 'approved')
        def approved(c):
            print ('expense approved')
            
        @to('denied')
        @when_all(m.subject == 'denied')
        def denied(c):
            print ('expense denied')
    
    # 'denied' and 'approved' are final states    
    state('denied')
    state('approved')

    @when_start
    def on_start(host):
        # events directed to default statechart instance
        host.post('expense', { 'subject': 'approve', 'amount': 100 });
        host.post('expense', { 'subject': 'approved' });
        
        # events directed to statechart instance with id '1'
        host.post('expense', { 'sid': 1, 'subject': 'approve', 'amount': 100 });
        host.post('expense', { 'sid': 1, 'subject': 'denied' });
        
        # events directed to statechart instance with id '2'
        host.post('expense', { 'sid': 2, 'subject': 'approve', 'amount': 10000 });
        
run_all()
```
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  
### Nested States
Nested states allow for writing compact statecharts. If a context is in the nested state, it also (implicitly) is in the surrounding state. The statechart will attempt to handle any event in the context of the sub-state. If the sub-state does not  handle an event, the event is automatically handled at the context of the super-state.

```python
from durable.lang import *

with statechart('worker'):
    # super-state 'work' has two states and one trigger
    with state('work'):
        # sub-sate 'enter' has only one trigger
        with state('enter'):
            @to('process')
            @when_all(m.subject == 'enter')
            def continue_process(c):
                print('start process')
    
        with state('process'):
            @to('process')
            @when_all(m.subject == 'continue')
            def continue_process(c):
                print('continue processing')

        # the super-state trigger will be evaluated for all sub-state triggers
        @to('canceled')
        @when_all(m.subject == 'cancel')
        def cancel(c):
            print('cancel process')

    state('canceled')

    @when_start
    def start(host):
        # will move the statechart to the 'work.process' sub-state
        host.post('worker', { 'subject': 'enter' })

        # will keep the statechart to the 'work.process' sub-state
        host.post('worker', { 'subject': 'continue' })
        host.post('worker', { 'subject': 'continue' })

        # will move the statechart out of the work state
        host.post('worker', { 'subject': 'cancel' })
        
run_all()
```
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)
### Flowchart
A flowchart is another way of organizing a ruleset flow. In a flowchart each stage represents an action to be executed. So (unlike the statechart state), when applied to the context state, it results in a transition to another stage.  

Flowchart rules:  
* A flowchart can have one or more stages.  
* A flowchart requires an initial stage.  
* An initial stage is defined as a vertex without incoming edges.  
* A stage can have an action.  
* A stage can have zero or more conditions.  
* A condition has a rule and a destination stage.  

```python
from durable.lang import *

with flowchart('expense'):
    # initial stage 'input' has two conditions
    with stage('input'): 
        to('request').when_all((m.subject == 'approve') & (m.amount <= 1000))
        to('deny').when_all((m.subject == 'approve') & (m.amount > 1000))
    
    # intermediate stage 'request' has an action and three conditions
    with stage('request'):
        @run
        def request(c):
            print('requesting approve')
            
        to('approve').when_all(m.subject == 'approved')
        to('deny').when_all(m.subject == 'denied')
        # reflexive condition: if met, returns to the same stage
        to('request').when_all(m.subject == 'retry')
    
    with stage('approve'):
        @run 
        def approved(c):
            print('expense approved')

    with stage('deny'):
        @run
        def denied(c):
            print('expense denied')

    @when_start
    def start(host):
        # events for the default flowchart instance, approved after retry
        host.post('expense', { 'subject': 'approve', 'amount': 100 })
        host.post('expense', { 'subject': 'retry' })
        host.post('expense', { 'subject': 'approved' })

        # events for the flowchart instance '1', denied after first try
        host.post('expense', { 'sid': 1, 'subject': 'approve', 'amount': 100})
        host.post('expense', { 'sid': 1, 'subject': 'denied'})

        # event for the flowchart instance '2' immediately denied
        host.post('expense', { 'sid': 2, 'subject': 'approve', 'amount': 10000})
        
run_all()
```
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  
### Timers
Events can be scheduled with timers. A timeout condition can be included in the rule antecedent. By default a timeuot is triggered as an event (observed only once). Timeouts can also be triggered as facts by 'manual reset' timers, the timers can be reset during action execution (see last example). 

* start_timer: starts a timer with the name and duration specified (manual_reset is optional).
* reset_timer: resets a 'manual reset' timer.
* cancel_timer: cancels ongoing timer.
* timeout: used as an antecedent condition.

In this example, the timer can be canceled by running the following command:  

<sub>`curl -H "content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"cancel": true}' http://localhost:5000/timer/events`</sub>  

```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('timer'):
    # will trigger when MyTimer expires
    @when_any(all(s.count == 0),
              all(s.count < 5,
                  timeout('MyTimer')))
    def pulse(c):
        c.s.count += 1
        # MyTimer will expire in 5 seconds
        c.start_timer('MyTimer', 5)
        print('pulse ->{0}'.format(datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%I:%M:%S%p')))
        
    @when_all(m.cancel == True)
    def cancel(c):
        c.cancel_timer('MyTimer')
        print('canceled timer')

    @when_start
    def on_start(host):
        host.patch_state('timer', { 'count': 0 })

run_all()
```

The example below uses a timer to detect higher event rate:  

```python
from durable.lang import *

with statechart('risk'):
    with state('start'):
        @to('meter')
        def start(c):
            c.start_timer('RiskTimer', 5)

    with state('meter'):
        @to('fraud')
        @when_all(count(3), c.message << m.amount > 100)
        def fraud(c):
            for e in c.m:
                print(e.message) 

        @to('exit')
        @when_all(timeout('RiskTimer'))
        def exit(c):
            print('exit')

    state('fraud')
    state('exit')

    @when_start
    def on_start(host):
        # three events in a row will trigger the fraud rule
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 200 })
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 300 })
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 400 })

        # two events will exit after 5 seconds
        host.post('risk', { 'sid': 1, 'amount': 500 })
        host.post('risk', { 'sid': 1, 'amount': 600 })
        
run_all()
```

In this example a manual reset timer is used for measuring velocity. Try issuing the command below multiple times.

<sub>`curl -H "content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"amount": 200}' http://localhost:5000/risk/events`</sub>  

```python
from durable.lang import *

with statechart('risk'):
    with state('start'):
        @to('meter')
        def start(c):
            c.start_timer('VelocityTimer', 5, True)

    with state('meter'):
        @to('meter')
        @when_all(cap(5), 
                  m.amount > 100,
                  timeout('VelocityTimer'))
        def some_events(c):
            print('velocity: {0} in 5 seconds'.format(len(c.m)))
            # resets and restarts the manual reset timer
            c.reset_timer('VelocityTimer')
            c.start_timer('VelocityTimer', 5, True)

        @to('meter')
        @when_all(pri(1), timeout('VelocityTimer'))
        def no_events(c):
            print('velocity: no events in 5 seconds')
            c.reset_timer('VelocityTimer')
            c.start_timer('VelocityTimer', 5, True)

    @when_start
    def on_start(host):
        # the velocity will be 4 events in 5 seconds
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 200 })
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 300 })
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 50 })
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 500 })
        host.post('risk', { 'amount': 600 })

run_all()
```
